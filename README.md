Scripts for analysis, experiment, visualisation I used for lab related works and my PhD. 

Currently, there are three folders:

 - Project_SCCA: 
    Analysis and visualisation scripts of the sparse cannonical correlation analysis project.
    I am slowly cleaning and annotating some of them.
 - Task scripts:
    All the tasks I have built since 2015. For those built after 2016, there is a very simple structure you can follow and modify.
    THEY ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK. I will add credits and refernce to each of them soon.
 - custom_modules: 
    As title. There are also some other general use scripts.


If you find any bug/problem/issue, please report on the repositories using the 'Issues' tab.
