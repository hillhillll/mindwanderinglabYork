For those built after 2016, there is a very simple structure you can follow and modify.\r\n\tTHEY ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK. \r\n\tI will add credits and refernce to each of them soon.\r\n\r\n - custom_modules: \r\n\r\n\tAs title. There are also some other general use scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any bug/problem/issue, please report on the repositories using the 'Issues' tab. \r\n",
